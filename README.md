# Mobile Caddy

Part of earning my Informatics Degree was completing a year-long web application project. My first personal project after graduation will be implementing a mobile version of this project using React Native! 

The web application a group of students and I developed during college is called Golf Buddy! It's an all in one resource for casual or avid golfers. It included a handful of features such as:
- Featured Courses
- Scoretracker & Scorecard
- Weather
- User Profile

My hope for this project is to implement a similar application for mobile users!
